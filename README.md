## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the `hotel_booking.csv`, which contains various attributes related to hotel bookings, including customer information, booking status, and more.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Inspection**: Displayed basic information about the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Created histograms, violin plots, and box plots to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Analyzed correlations among numeric features to identify patterns.

## 📈 Modeling
The following machine learning models were implemented:
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 🏅
2. **Logistic Regression** 📊
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 🚀

Each model was evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📉 Results
- Model performances were compared using accuracy scores.
- Insights gained from the analysis can guide hotels in managing bookings more effectively.

## 🚀 Usage
- Open Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
- Run the scripts in the following order:
  1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Model Training and Evaluation
